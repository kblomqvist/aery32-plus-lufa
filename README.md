# Aery32+LUFA

This is an attempt to integrate LUFA with Aery32 Framework. Since Aery32 Framework switched to avr32-g++ LUFA stopped working with it. The older but working version can be downloaded from [AVR Freaks forum](http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=970571#970571).

The example software implements CDC demo.
